# stwsim-rpc

...is a hand crafted Discord RichPresence which allows you to share your activity in StellwerkSim directly to your friends on Discord.
It shows which switch tower you are currently on, if you are in practice mode or in an online session, and how much time has passed since you started the plugin.
It is made out of 100% Java.

## How to?
You only have to activate the plugin interface under "Optionen" -> "Pluginschnittstelle starten"...

...and then execute the .jar-file in a command prompt window.

As soon as all the connections are working, you should receive a console output saying "Ready! You can minimize this window now.".


## Great, but how does it look like on Discord?
